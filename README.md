- 👋 Hi, I’m @allenjavil (Allen)! A freshman at Harvard College intending to concentrate in MechE with a CS secondary ;).
- 👀 Coding-wise, I’m interested in data science, game development, and improving my code optimization/efficiency skills. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning techniques, Japanese, and Photoshop editing.
- 📫 How to reach me? [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allenga777/) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/allenjavil/)! Happy to connect.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am originally from Mexico (specifically from Veracruz). Thus, I am a geek for Mexican history and love Mexican food 😋.
- ⏰ My goal for 2025 is to create a weekly coding project, mainly focusing on web/game development, data science, and problem-solving algorithms. I aim to save my journey here!
